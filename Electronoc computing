One of the largest electro-mechanichal computers build was Harvard mmark 1.
  - it was completed in 1944 by IBM for allies during world war 2.
  - it contained 765,000 components, three million connections and 500 miles of wire.
 
Earlist use of this technology was running simltanious calculations for the manhattan project.
The Harvard mark 1 could do 3 additionals or subtractions per second and division took 15sec.
*the Harvard mark ! also attracted insects. and in september 1947 operations pulled a dead moth from a
malfunctioning relay.
  -from then on when anything went wrong with a computer we say it has bugs in it.
The first large scale use of vacuum tubes for computing was the colossus mark 1 designed by engineer Tommy Flowers 
in December of 1943.
  -and the first colssus computer contained 1600 vacuum tubes and they were regarded as the first programmable computer.
  -it was operational for 10 years.
In 1947, bell laboratory scientists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley invented a transistor and a whole
new era of computing was born.
Transistor is like a relay or vacuum tube. a switch that can be opend or closed by applying electrical power
