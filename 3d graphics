the transition from 2D to 3D graphics, emphasizing the need to render 3D objects onto a 2D screen s .
3D graphics utilize three coordinates (x, y, z) for points, which must be projected onto a 2D plane 


3D Projection Techniques

The process of flattening 3D coordinates onto a 2D plane is known as 3D projection, with orthographic and perspective projections being common types s s .
Perspective projection mimics how parallel lines converge in the real world, while orthographic projection maintains parallelism.
