arrays- series of values stored in memory index.

- arrays are extrmely versertile data structures, used all the time and so there are many functions 
  that can handle them to do useful thinggs.
- arrays can be easily sorted using built-in functions present in most programming languages


Strings
- Strings are special types of arrays that store characters, ending with a null character (binary 0) to indicate termination.

Matrices
- Matrices are essentially arrays of arrays, allowing for two-dimensional data storage, such as gridsss.



Structs
- Structs allow for bundling related variables into a single compound data structure, useful for managing multiple pieces of information togetherss.
- Arrays of structs can be created, but they have fixed sizes


Trees
- Trees structure data with nodes containing pointers to children, forming hierarchy, with terminology like root, parent, and leaf nodesss.
 - Binary trees have nodes with up to two children, but variations exist for trees with more

Graphs
- Graphs allow for connections between nodes without inherent parent-child relationships, providing flexible data mappin
