-Vision is the highest bandwidth sense, providing extensive information about the world and guiding actions.
-Computer scientists have pursued computer vision for over fifty years, aiming to enable computers to understand digital images and videos.

Basics of Image Representation

-Digital images are stored as grids of pixels, with each pixel defined by an RGB value, representing combinations of red, green, and blue.
-A simple computer vision algorithm can track colored objects by comparing RGB values to find the closest match.


Edge Detection and Convolution

-To identify features larger than a pixel, algorithms analyze small regions of pixels, known as patches s .
-Edge detection can be performed using kernels, which apply mathematical operations to pixel values to identify significant color differences s s .
-The Prewitt Operators are examples of kernels used to enhance vertical and horizontal edges in images


Applications of Computer Vision

-Computer vision algorithms can pinpoint facial landmarks, enabling emotion recognition and context-sensitive responses.
-Applications extend to biometric recognition, such as smartphones unlocking via facial recognition, and interpreting body language and gestures.
-The field is rapidly evolving, with breakthroughs in technology enhancing the capabilities of computer vision systems. 

-The integration of advanced computer vision into everyday technology, such as self-driving cars and interactive systems, is transforming human-computer interaction
