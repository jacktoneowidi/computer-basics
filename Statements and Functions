Introduction to Programming Languages
- Programming languages were developed to abstract low-level machine code details, allowing programmers to focus on problem-solving.

Basic Statements and Variables
- Programming statements are complete thoughts, similar to sentences in spoken languages; for example, "A equals 5" is an assignment statements.


- Variables can be named anything, but best practices suggest naming them in a meaningful way.
Control Flow Statements.

- Control Flow Statements allow the program to move beyond linear execution. The most common are If Statements, structured as if X is true, then do y.
- If Statements can be combined with ELSE statements also.

Loops, While and For loops
 - while loop allows the repeated execution of code while a certain condition remains true, which can be used for tasks like restocking items in a game.
-For loops are count-controlled, executing a block of code a specific number of times making them uesful in repeating tasks.


functions

-functions allow for the encapsulation of code, letting programmers call the function name to execute complex logic without altering its internal workingss.
- they can take parameters and return results, significantly improving code modularity and readabilitys.
