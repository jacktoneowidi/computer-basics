Natural Language Processing NLP

-Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field that combines computer science and linguistics, aimed at enabling computers to understand human language.
-Unlike programming languages, which have strict syntax and limited vocabulary, natural languages are complex, featuring diverse vocabularies, multiple meanings, and various accents.

Key Components of NLP

-Parts of Speech: Understanding the nine fundamental types of English words (nouns, pronouns, articles, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections) is crucial for NLP.
-Phrase Structure Rules: These rules define how sentences are constructed, allowing computers to parse sentences into manageable parts s . For example, a sentence can consist of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase.

-Parse Trees - These structures tag each word with its likely part of speech and illustrate sentence construction, facilitating easier processing of language.
-Text Generation: NLP systems can generate natural language text by utilizing structured data and semantic relationships. 


Machine Learning in NLP

-Modern chatbots and dialogue systems leverage machine learning, using vast datasets of human conversations to improve their responses.
-This shift from rule-based systems to machine learning has enhanced the sophistication of chatbots s .
-Language Models: These models improve transcription accuracy by predicting likely word sequences, thus aiding in speech recognition.

Speech Synthesis
Speech synthesis involves converting text into spoken words, utilizing phonetic components to produce more natural-sounding speech s . While current synthesized voices are improving, they still lack the nuance of human speech .

Speech Recognition


-Speech recognition technology has evolved significantly since its inception, with early systems like Bell Labs' "Audrey" recognizing only digits s . Modern systems utilize deep neural networks for improved accuracy.
-Spectrograms: These visual representations of sound help in distinguishing different vowel sounds, crucial for accurate speech recognition.
