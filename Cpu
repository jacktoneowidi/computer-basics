Central processing unit - cpu , thecomputers heart.

Components of a cpu
1.Alu - Arithmetic logic unit.
2.Registers.
3.Ram.

The cpu executes programs made up of individual operations called instructions such as addition  or memory read and write.

Memory and Instructions
he design includes a RAM module with 16 memory locations and four 8-bit registers (A, B, C, D).


CPU Operations
We have three phases in cpu cycle;
They include; 
1. Fetch
2. Decode
3. Execute Cycle

Fetch phase
 - fetch phase, where the Instruction Address Register retrieves the current instruction from RAM.

Decode phase

 - decode phase interprets the fetched instruction with the opcode indicating the specific operation, which is recognized by the Control Unit using logic gates.
Execute phase
 - execute phase carries out the instruction, involving data retrieval from RAM, manipulation within registers, and use of the ALU as necessary.

Control Unit and Clock


The clock generates regular electrical signals to synchronize CPU operations, defining the clock speed measured in Hertz.
The first chip CPU, the Intel 4004, released in 1971, had a clock speed of 740 Kilohertz.
Modern CPUs operate at speeds in gigahertz (billions of cycles per second), significantly outperforming early models.
Overclocking increases CPU speed but can lead to overheating or errors; underclocking is beneficial for energy efficiency.
