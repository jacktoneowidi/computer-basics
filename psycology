Understanding Human-Computer Interaction

-The video emphasizes the importance of understanding both computers and humans to create effective and enjoyable computer systems. It highlights that humans are
 inherently messy and unpredictable, which contrasts with the logical nature of computers. 
-This understanding is crucial for 
 system designers who apply principles from social, cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual psychology to enhance usability.

Usability and Design Principles

-Usability is defined as the effectiveness and efficiency with which users can achieve their objectives using a computer interface. Poor usability can lead to frustration and abandonment of tasks. Designers
 must consider human visual perception, as people excel at ordering color intensities but struggle with color ordering, which can lead to poor data representation.
-Effective esign also involves chunking information, which helps users process and remember data more easily.

Computer-Mediated Communication
-The video discusses computer-mediated communication (CMC), which includes both synchronous and asynchronous interactions. Research indicates that people tend to disclose more personal information in CMC than in face-to-face
 settings, suggesting that designing systems for such interactions can enhance user engagement
