Internet Structure


-Internet StructuThe internet is a large distributed network that connects devices through local area networks (lan)
 and wide area networks (wan) managed by Internet Service Providers isp like Comcast and Verizonre.

-Data travels through multiple hops, connecting to regional routers and ultimately reaching the backbone of the internet,
 which consists of high-bandwidth routers

Data Transmission Protocols

-Data on the internet is sent in small packets, which may be broken down further if the data is large, such as video streams.
-User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple protocol that allows packets to be sent without ensuring delivery, making it suitable for
 applications like video chat where speed is prioritized over reliability.


Error Handling and Reliability

-UDP includes a checksum for data verification, but it does not provide mechanisms for correcting errors or confirming packet delivery s s .
-The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) offers more reliability by sequencing packets and requiring acknowledgments for successful delivery, making it ideal for applications like email s s .
-TCP can handle out-of-order packets and retransmit lost packets, adjusting its transmission rate based on network conditions 

Domain Name System
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, functioning like a phone book for the internet 

DNS uses a hierarchical structure with top-level domains (TLDs) and lower-level domains to manage over 300 million registered domain names.
And the  OSI model consists of multiple layers, including the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer (where TCP and UDP operate), and session layer.
