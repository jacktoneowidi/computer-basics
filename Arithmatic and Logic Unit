-Cpu - central processing unit.
-The Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) is considered the "mathematical brain" of a computer, performing essential computations like addition and subtraction. 
 Understanding the ALU's design and function is crucial for comprehending modern computerss.
-constructing a simple ALU circuit using Boolean logic gates, specifically the Intel 74181, a notable early ALU that fit fully on a single chipss.
The ALU is divided into an arithmetic unit and a logic unit, starting with the arithmetic unit, which handles numerical operations like additions.

Logic Unit of the ALU

-The ALU also incorporates a Logic Unit for logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT, along with numerical testss.
-A circuit example checks if an ALU output is zero utilizing OR and NOT gatess.

Complex ALUs and Operation Codes

The Intel 74181 is a 4-bit ALU; however, the constructed 8-bit ALU is more capable. A 4-bit operation code determines which operation the ALU performs, such as addition or subtractionss.
ALUs output flags, including Zero, Negative, and Overflow flags, which track specific states during operations and informs the processor about conditions like equality and overflows.
