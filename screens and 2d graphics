Screens and 2D Graphics

-Screens are essential tools for visual interfaces in computing, evolving from simple displays to 
 sophisticated technologies like lcd and oled.


Pixels and Resolution

-pixel short for picture element, represents the smallest unit of a digital image displayed on screenss.
-Resolution is determined by the number of pixels displayed on a screen, affecting the clarity and detail of the image.


-Computers represent colors through a combination of red, green, and blue (RGB), which allows for millions of
 possible color combinations.



2D Graphics Rendering

2D graphics rendering involves converting shapes and images into pixels for display on screens, governed by
coordinates on a grid.

Technologies such as rasterization and vector graphics play significant roles in how images are generated and displayed.
