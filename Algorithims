Algorithim - set by set instructions of solving a particular problem.
- The term "algorithm" originates from the Persian polymath Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, one of the fathers of algebras.

Sorting algorithms.
- Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science, essential in various applications, from finding airfare to organizing contacts
 - Selection Sort is introduced as a basic sorting algorithm that involves scanning the array for the smallest number and swapping it into the correct position.
- Merge Sort is presented as a more efficient sorting algorithm with a complexity of N times the Log of N, which significantly optimizes performance on larger datasetss.
- complexity of Selection Sort is demonstrated as N squared, indicating that as the array size increases, the running time increases dramatically


- Dijkstra's algorithm is described as a classic solution for finding the shortest path in a graph, initially working by exploring nodes with the lowest known cost.
 - Dijkstra's algorithm is utilized in real-world applications, such as finding routes on Google Map
