cryptography

-Cryptography is a key aspect of computer security, employing multiple layers of security mechanisms known as defense in depth to protect systems from attacks.
The term cryptography translates to secret writing involving ciphers that convert plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable without a key.


Types of Ciphers

-Ciphers can be categorized into substitution ciphers, like the Caesar cipher, which shifts letters in a message, and permutation ciphers, which 
 rearrange letters based on a grid.
-The Enigma machine, used by the Nazis, mechanized cryptography with multiple rotors and a plugboard, enhancing complexity beyond simple substitution.


Key Exchange and Asymmetric Encryption

-Key exchange algorithms, like Diffie-Hellman, allow secure sharing of keys over public channels without direct transmission of the key itself.
-Asymmetric encryption, such as RSA, utilizes a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, ensuring secure communication without sharing secret keys.
