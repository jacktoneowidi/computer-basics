compression

- compression is the process of reducing tthe size of files to save stroage space and improve transmission speed.


Types of Compression

- lossless compression techniques allow the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data

Lossy Compression

- lossy compression techniques discard some data, particularly information that is less perceptible to human sensess.
-in audio compression, frequencies that humans cannot hear, such as ultrasonic sounds, can be removed to save spaces.

- jPEG is a common lossy image format that reduces file size by discarding high-frequency spatial data that is less noticeable to the human eye


Audio and Video Compression

Compressed audio files, like MP3s, can be significantly smaller than uncompressed formats, allowing for more efficient storage and transmissions.
Video compression takes advantage of temporal redundancy by not retransmitting unchanged pixels between frames, which can lead to significant reductions in file size

Importance of Compression

compression techniques are essential for efficiently storing and transmitting various types of data, including images, music, and videos.
