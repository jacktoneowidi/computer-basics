There are three types of hackers
 -white hat hacker
 -black hat hacker
 -grey hat hacker r



-White hat hackers are ethical hackers who identify and fix security vulnerabilities, often hired by companies
 and governments for security evaluations.
-Black hat hackers are malicious individuals who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain, often for monetary reasons

Common Hacking Techniques

-Social engineering is a prevalent method where hackers manipulate users into revealing confidential information, often through phishing emails that lead to fake websites s s .
-Pretexting involves attackers impersonating trusted individuals to extract sensitive information from victims, demonstrating the effectiveness of research and deception in hacking s .
-Malware, including ransomware, is often delivered through seemingly harmless attachments, posing significant risks to users' data and systems.


Cybersecurity Practices

-Developers should implement bounds checking and input sanitization to prevent buffer overflow and code injection attacks, ensuring that user inputs are treated as potentially dangerous s .
-Keeping software updated is crucial to protect against zero-day vulnerabilities, which are newly discovered bugs that hackers exploit before patches are available s s .
-Cyberattacks pose significant economic threats, costing the global economy approximately half a trillion dollars annually, highlighting the importance of robust cybersecurity measures

-Code injection attacks, particularly SQL injection, exploit vulnerabilities in database queries, enabling attackers to manipulate or delete data without needing valid credentials
