-Early computing devices relied on mechanical controls for inputs and outputs, limiting human interaction to
physical controls like gears and knobs.

-The first electronic computers used large panels for configuration, which made programming time-consuming


Keyboards

-Keyboards became prominent as smaller computers became accessible for interactive human input, spearheading
the transition towards more user-friendly interfaces.

-The qwerty keyboard layout, created by Christopher Latham Sholes in 1868, became standard due to its commercial
success and usersâ€™ reluctance to learn new layouts

Screen-Based Interfaces

-By the late 1970s, screen-based terminals replaced electromechanical teletype machines, facilitating a better user 
experience with functionalities like error corrections.

-The transition to screens maintained the text-only protocol from teletype machines, ensuring continuity in user 
interaction despite technological advancements.

-Command line interfaces remain powerful tools for programmers and are commonly used for remote server accesss.
Modern operating systems, including Windows and macOS, still incorporate command line interfaces that users can explore.
