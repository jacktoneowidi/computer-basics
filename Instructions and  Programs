               Instructions and Programs

The thing that makes a cpu powerful is the fact that its programmable.
The cpu is built from components like an ALU and control unit, is programmable and executes instructions given through software and
RAM holds both instructions and data in a binary format.

              Basic cpu instructions
 CPU consist of an opcode first four bits and an addres and register value, last four bits
 Basic operations include loading values into registers, performing arithmetic operations like adding, subtracting.


            
             Real-World CPU Example
the Intel 4004, released in 1971, was the first single-chip CPU supporting 46 instructions, laying the groundwork for future processors.
modern processors, such as the Intel Core i7, feature thousands of instructions and variants, reflecting significant advancements in technology and design.
