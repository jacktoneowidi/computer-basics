software engineering – computer science branch that deals with the systematic designs, testing, developing and maintaining of software.

Computer programming – also referred to as coding. the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks.


Object oriented programing 

 Breaking large programs into smaller functions allows multiple programmers to work on different parts simultaneously. 


Documentation  and apis
 Api- application programmable interface they are essential for collaboration among programmers, ensuring that functions
 and other components can be used without needing to understand their implementation in detail.

 different programming teams can collaborate, providing controlled access to functions within a codebase

Integrated Development Environments IDEs.
-intergrated development enviroment.
 are specialized tools for programming that provide features like error checking, code navigation, and organization, 
 enhancing the coding process.

-they aid in the testing and debugging.

Source Control and Collaboration
 -Source Control systems manage code versions, allowing teams to check out and modify code safely while keeping the main repository.
 -Tracking changes is critical for collaboration; it allows teams to avoid conflicts and revert to stable versions if bugs arise


Quality Assurance and Testing
quality assuarance is the process whre a dedicated team test software to identify and fix bugs
