compurer memory and storage


Computer memory is generally non-permanent (volatile). If power is lost, any data saved in memory is lost.
Storage is non-volatile; data stays until it is overwritten or deleted


early storage technology
 -earliest forms of storage included paper punch cards, which allowed for the storage of data but were slow.
- Magnetic core memory, introduced in the mid-1950s, used magnetic cores to store data and became the predominant random 
  access memory technology for two decades.

Development of Magnetic Tape and Drives
Advancements in Storage Technologies
-Hard disk drives further improved storage capabilities and became common by the 1970s, offering up to one terabyte of 
 data.
- Floppy disks were widely used for portable storage until the mid-90s
- Optical storage technologies like CDs and DVDs emerged in the 1970s





Modern Storage Solid State Drives.
- first RAM integrated circuits appeared in 1972, paving the way for solid-state drives (SSDs) with no moving parts
- SSDs have much faster access times compared to traditional hard drives, contributing to changing storage hierarchies in computers 
  today
