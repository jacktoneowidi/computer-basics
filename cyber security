Introduction to Cybersecurity

-Cybersecurity is essential to protect against crime and harm in the virtual world, similar to physical security measures in the real worlds.
-The field evolves rapidly, encompassing techniques to ensure the secrecy, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data.
Goals of Cybersecurity

Confidentiality Only authorized individuals should access specific data; breaches occur when hackers expose sensitive informations.
Integrity: Ensures that only authorized users can modify systems and data; attacks on integrity involve unauthorized actions like impersonations.
Availability: Authorized users must always access their systems; denial of service attacks compromise this goal by overwhelming systems.
