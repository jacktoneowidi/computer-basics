introduction to computer networks


- The internet revolutionized communication, allowing instant information exchange 
  compared to the weeks it took for letters to travel historically.

 -This transformation significantly boosted the global economy by enhancing
  data transfer speeds through fiber optic cables.

early computer networks
The first computer networks emerged in the 1950s and 60s, primarily within organizations to facilitate faster and more reliable information exchange.
Early networks allowed resource sharing, such as printers and storage drives, leading to the development of Local Area Networks.



Ethernet, developed in the early 1970s, became the most successful LAN technology, connecting computers via a shared cable s .
Each computer on an Ethernet network has a unique MAC address, allowing it to identify and process relevant data


Collision Management

- Ethernet employs Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) to manage data transmission and reduce collisions s .
- In case of a collision, computers use an exponential backoff strategy to wait before retransmitting, which helps manage network traffic.

Packet switching, developed during the Cold War, allows data to be divided into packets for efficient routing across networks.
The ARPANET was the first packet-switching network, laying the groundwork for the modern internet.
