Introduction to Cybersecurity

-Cybersecurity is essential to protect against crime and harm in the virtual world, similar to physical security measures in the real worlds.
-The field evolves rapidly, encompassing techniques to ensure the secrecy, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data.
Goals of Cybersecurity

-Confidentiality Only authorized individuals should access specific data; breaches occur when hackers expose sensitive informations.

-Integrity: Ensures that only authorized users can modify systems and data; attacks on integrity involve unauthorized actions like impersonations.

-Availability: Authorized users must always access their systems; denial of service attacks compromise this goal by overwhelming systems.

Security Challenges and Solutions

-Trust in hardware and software is crucial; malware can compromise security programs s .
-Reducing implementation errors is vital, and independent verification helps identify vulnerabilities s .
-Isolation techniques, such as sandboxing applications, limit the impact of compromised programs


Access Control

-Access control specifies who can see, modify, and use data through permissions and access control lists.
-The Bella-Padula model ensures that users cannot access information beyond their clearance level, maintaining secrecy and integrity
