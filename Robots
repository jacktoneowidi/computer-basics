robots
-Robots are defined as machines capable of performing a series of actions automatically, guided by computer control, regardless of their appearance.
-The term "robot" originates from a 1920 Czech play, derived from the Slavic word for forced labor, indicating a historical context of automation and 
 servitude.


Development of Robotics

-The first computer-controlled machines emerged in the late 1940s, leading to the development of CNC machines that revolutionized manufacturing by automating complex tasks.
-The robotics industry began with the Unimate, the first commercial industrial robot, which was used by General Motors in 1960

Challenges in Robotics

-Despite advancements, robots struggle with tasks that humans find trivial, such as walking or manipulating objects, highlighting ongoing challenges in robotics research .
-Self-driving cars exemplify the complexity of robotic systems, requiring sophisticated sensing and computer vision to navigate environments safely.

Ethical Considerations
-The development of lethal autonomous weapons raises significant ethical concerns, as these systems could operate without human judgment in critical situations s s .
-Isaac Asimov's fictional "Three Laws of Robotics" serve as a moral framework for discussions about robot ethics, emphasizing the need for responsible design and application of robotic technologies

The duality of robotics as both beneficial and potentially harmful technology necessitates careful reflection on its implications for society and the responsibilities of creators.
