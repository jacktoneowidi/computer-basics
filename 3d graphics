the transition from 2D to 3D graphics, emphasizing the need to render 3D objects onto a 2D screen s .
3D graphics utilize three coordinates (x, y, z) for points, which must be projected onto a 2D plane 


3D Projection Techniques

The process of flattening 3D coordinates onto a 2D plane is known as 3D projection, with orthographic and perspective projections being common types s s .
Perspective projection mimics how parallel lines converge in the real world, while orthographic projection maintains parallelism.

Rendering Methods

Wireframe rendering connects 3D points to create a visual representation, akin to building a cube with chopsticks s .
Scanline renderiLighting and Texturing

Lighting algorithms, such as flat shading, enhance realism by varying illumination based on polygon orientation s s .
Texture mapping applies surface images to polygons, enriching the visual detail of 3D objects s .

Performance Optimization

Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) are designed to handle complex calculations for rendering, allowing for massive parallel processing of polygons s sng fills polygons
by calculating pixel intersections row by row, enhancing the visual output
