  Ram - Random access memory.
Ram is discussed as a temporary storage solution that holds information like gam states 
while power is on.

Building simple memory circuits
Two types of circuits are explored 
   1) using an OR gatethat permarnently records a 1 and another with an AND gate 
      records a 0 resulting into a latch.

Latches - Are digital circuits that store a single bit of information and hold its value
          until it is updated by new input signals.
A gated latch is introduced that allows for a single data wire and a write enable line to 
control data entry.

Registers and Latches
By linking eight latches together, an 8-bit register can be formed with each latch represents a bit of a number.

Addressing Memory with gridd and multiplexers
The matrix structure enabled easy selection of individual latches using row and column wires, controlled by AND gates.
